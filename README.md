## Tech stack

- [Astro](https://astro.build) - static site generator, ships zero JS by default
- [React](https://react.dev) - interactive islands only (hero, feature showcase, FAQ, theme toggle)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) v4 - utility-first styling, mapped to CSS variables for theme awareness
- [motion](https://motion.dev) (Framer Motion) - React component animations
- [Lenis](https://lenis.darkroom.engineering) - smooth scroll
- [GSAP](https://gsap.com) - scroll-triggered timelines
- Deployed to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions

No Jekyll, no Ruby, no Liquid templates. No third-party fonts, scripts, or trackers (except the animation libs listed above).

## Local development

Requires Node.js 24+ and npm 11+.

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the URL Astro prints (typically <http://localhost:4321/>).

## Build and preview

```sh
npm run build      # production build to dist/
npm run preview    # preview the production build locally
```

## Deployment

Pushing to `main` triggers the GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, which builds the site and deploys `dist/` to GitHub Pages.

The GitHub repo must be configured to use GitHub Actions as the Pages source (Settings > Pages > Source > GitHub Actions). This is a one-time manual step.

The site is served at the custom domain `alcove-app.com` (apex, no base path), configured in `astro.config.mjs`. All internal links use `import.meta.env.BASE_URL`.
